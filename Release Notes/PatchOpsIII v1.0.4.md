## üöÄ **New Features & Improvements:**
- **Enhanced User Experience (UI Responsiveness):**
  - Applying Steam launch options and installing the T7 Patch now run asynchronously in separate threads, preventing the UI from freezing during these operations.
- **Improved DXVK-GPLAsync Installation:**
  - The DXVK-GPLAsync installation is more robust, as it now recursively searches for the necessary DLL files within the extracted archive, making it less dependent on a specific folder structure.
  - Downloaded DXVK-GPLAsync archives will retain their original filenames for better clarity.
- **Direct Game Launch:**
  - A new "Launch Game" button has been added to the main window, allowing users to directly launch Black Ops III via Steam from within the application.
- **Refactored Codebase:**
  - Common utility functions related to Steam integration and launch options have been moved to a new `utils.py` module, improving code organization and maintainability.
- **Linux Compatibility Improvements:**
  - A default game directory path for Linux installations has been added.
  - Improved handling of Steam processes on Linux with more robust process checks and timeouts.
- **Robust Launch Options Management:**
  - The logic for setting Steam launch options has been refined to better handle existing `fs_game` parameters, ensuring correct application of new options without conflicts.
  - Timeouts have been added to Steam process management commands for more reliable execution.
- **T7 Patch Installation Enhancements:**
  - The T7 Patch installation now includes a check for administrator privileges on Windows and will prompt for elevation if necessary, ensuring successful installation.

## üõ† **Fixes:**
