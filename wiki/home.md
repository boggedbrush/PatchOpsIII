# PatchOpsIII Wiki  

## Overview  
PatchOpsIII is a Python-based application developed by [boggedbrush](https://github.com/boggedbrush/PatchOpsIII). The project is designed to streamline and optimize operations through a robust and versatile framework.

## Features  

### 1. Mods Tab

#### 1.1 Game Directory  
Allows users to specify their game directory. The default behavior is to search for:  

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III

If the directory isn't found, users can manually select the game's installation folder using the "Browse" button at the top right.  

#### 1.2 T7Patch Management  
The **T7 Patch** is a community-developed modification for *Call of Duty: Black Ops III* that addresses various security vulnerabilities and performance issues within the game.  

**Key Benefits:**  
- Fixes remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities  
- Prevents potential exploits  
- Resolves FPS-related problems  

PatchOpsIII enables users to:  
- Install and update the T7 Patch  
- Update their gamertag  
- Set their gamertag color
- Configure network password
- Toggle Friends Only Mode
- Install LPC to resolve A.B.C errors
- Uninstall T7Patch when needed

This management only needs to run once and does not require `t7patch.exe` to remain open in the background. Implementing the T7 Patch is crucial for maintaining game security and performance, as it safeguards against known exploits and enhances overall stability.  

You can learn more about the T7 Patch [here](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7patch).  

#### 1.3 DXVK-GPLAsync Management  
**Shader compilation stuttering** is a common issue in PC gaming, causing noticeable delays when new shaders are compiled during gameplay. DXVK-GPLAsync offers a solution by converting **DirectX** calls to **Vulkan** with asynchronous shader compilation, reducing stutters and enhancing overall performance.  

**Feature Highlights:**  
- Install/uninstall `dxvk-gplasync`  
- Minimize in-game stuttering caused by real-time shader compilation  
- Enhance performance and reduce latency, especially for stutter-prone games
